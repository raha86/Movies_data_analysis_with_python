# Project Learnings

1) Performed data cleaning and manipulations
2) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
3) Identified many behavioural patterns of viewers like most popular genres, most popular contexts etc. Identified most popular and most rated movies. Also identified that popularity and rating of movies are not dependent on each other. Identified the time duration of the movies that are more popular amongst people.
